What kind of ERP/CRM system does Goodwill Industries use? For case management?

It appears that they use Paylocity (FE) on the front end and may use GreenHouse
or BambooHR for their ATS.

please provide a script to extract data values and tags from a
pdf form to a JSON format using both python and javascript



Extracting Data from PDF Forms
Here's an approach to extract data and tags from a PDF form into JSON format,
using both Python and Javascript. It's important to note that achieving this
functionality can be complex and might not work perfectly with all PDF forms
due to variations in format.

1. Python using PyPDF2 and json libraries:

Python
import json
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

def extract_pdf_data(filename):
  """
  Extracts data and field names from a PDF form.

  Args:
      filename: Path to the PDF form file.

  Returns:
      A dictionary containing extracted data or None if extraction fails.
  """
  try:
    reader = PdfReader(filename)
    form_data = {}
    for field_name, field in reader.acroForm.fields.items():
      if field.get_annot().is_hidden:
        continue  # Skip hidden fields
      if field.get_annot().FT == b'/Btn':  # Handle buttons separately
        form_data[field_name] = "Button"
      else:
        value = field.get_value() or ""  # Get value or empty string
        form_data[field_name] = value
    return form_data
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error extracting data: {e}")
    return None

# Example usage
data = extract_pdf_data("your_form.pdf")
if data:
  with open("extracted_data.json", "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(data, outfile, indent=4)
  print("Data extraction successful!")
else:
  print("Failed to extract data from PDF form.")
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This script uses PyPDF2 to access the PDF form fields and extract their
names and values. It then converts the extracted data to a dictionary and
saves it as a JSON file.

2. Javascript (Limited Functionality):

Due to limitations in browser environments for security reasons, directly extracting data from a local PDF file using Javascript is generally not possible. However, you can achieve a similar effect for online forms using Javascript libraries like PDF.js. Here's a simplified example (not recommended for production use):

JavaScript
async function extractFormData(url) {
  // Load the PDF document
  const pdfDoc = await PDFJS.getDocument(url);

  // Get the first page (adjust as needed)
  const page = await pdfDoc.getPage(1);

  // Extract text content (might not capture field data well)
  const textContent = await page.getTextContent();

  // Basic parsing (replace with more sophisticated logic)
  const formData = {};
  for (const item of textContent.items) {
    const [fieldName, value] = item.str.split(":");
    if (fieldName && value) {
      formData[fieldName.trim()] = value.trim();
    }
  }

  return formData;
}

// Example usage (replace with actual form URL)
const formUrl = "https://example.com/form.pdf";

extractFormData(formUrl)
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error(error));
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This script utilizes PDF.js to fetch and partially parse the PDF content. Note that this approach is unreliable for extracting data from fillable forms and might only capture visible text. It's more suitable for simple text-based PDFs.

Remember:

These are simplified examples and might require adjustments based on specific PDF structures.
Consider using dedicated PDF form processing libraries or tools for more robust solutions.
